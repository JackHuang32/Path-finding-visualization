This is a A* shortest path simulation using pygame.  
For those who are interested in, you can download the three .py files and  type "python main.py" to run the program.  
You can click the left mouse button to place the start(green) and end(red) and forbidden(black) spot.  
Clicking right mouse button on the colored spot can make it become white(origin).  
After the selection of start and end, you can hit the space to activate the algorithm animation, which the teal spot represent the spot finish relaxing and the purple spots represent the spots being relaxed.  
After the animation, you can press 'R' to clear the purple and teal spots and keep on above operations. Or you can press 'C' to clean up all colored spots.
